Hannah here, I am an aspiring data scientist, programmer and certified financial analyst candidate. I am using Github as a way to help manage and provide consistent platform for storing my learnings. 
My goal is to become efficient by May of 2021 in programming by leveraging course learnings and reiterating it through code. Courses are completed through Coursera with a supplement of books for additional support. I will be storing various mini project that will range from attempts of games to in depth analyses, any feedback is appreciated as I learn.
