basics create a repository 
Hannah here, I am an aspiring data scientist, programmer and certified financial analyst candidate. I am using Github as a way to help manage and provide consistent platform for storing my learnings. 
My goal is to become advanced in programming by leveraging courses I am enrolled in through Coursera, books I am reading, and various mini project attempts of games, analyses, etc.
